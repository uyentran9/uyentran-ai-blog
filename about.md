## Uyen Tran (Victoria Tran)

I am a Pricing Analyst at Abbott Diabetes Care transitioning into **AI and Machine Learning**, with a long-term goal of working at the intersection of **Quantum Machine Learning** and **Drug Discovery**.

My background in **Statistics and Economics**, combined with intensive retraining in **modern AI/ML systems**, has motivated me to pursue graduate study and contribute to computational methods for biomedical research.

## **Education**
- **B.A. in Statistics & B.A. in Economics**, University of California, Berkeley  
- **AIO 2025 Program (Vietnam/Japan/Korea)** — intensive AI curriculum:  
  Python, Algorithms, Deep Learning, LLMs, NLP, GNNs, MLOps, and Quantum ML

### **Selected Online Coursework (ongoing)**
To strengthen my foundation for graduate study, I am also completing well-known open courses:
- *Machine Learning* — Andrew Ng (Stanford / Coursera)  
- *CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks* — Stanford  
- *CS224n: NLP with Deep Learning* — Stanford  
- *DeepLearning.AI: Generative AI & LLMs* — OpenAI / DeepLearning.AI  
- *IBM Qiskit: Introduction to Quantum Computing* — IBM Quantum  
- *Xanadu Quantum Machine Learning Tutorials* — Pennylane  
- *MIT Jameel Clinic Talks on AI for Drug Discovery* — MIT CSAIL & J-Clinic

## **Current Focus**
- Strengthening core CS skills: Python, algorithms, data structures  
- Deep Learning: LLMs, NLP, Graph Neural Networks  
- Quantum computing and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms  
- Applying AI to molecular modeling, biomedical prediction, and computational chemistry  

---

## **Research & Career Interests**
My long-term research interest lies in building AI systems for **drug discovery**, including:
- molecular representation learning (GNNs, transformers)  
- generative models for molecular design (diffusion models, VAEs)  
- quantum-inspired or hybrid quantum-classical ML  
- scalable ML systems for biomedical data

I am especially motivated by how **AI + chemistry + quantum algorithms** can accelerate early-stage drug development.

## **Goals**
- Pursue a **Master’s in Computer Science (Fall 2026 target)** with a pathway toward a **PhD in CS**  
- Contribute to research in:
  - Machine Learning for drug discovery  
  - Molecular machine learning and computational biology  
  - Quantum ML algorithms  
- Eventually work as a **Data Scientist / Research Scientist** applying AI to real-world biomedical problems
