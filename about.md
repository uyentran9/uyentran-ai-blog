## Uyen Tran (Victoria Tran)

I am a Pricing Analyst at Abbott Diabetes Care transitioning into **AI and Machine Learning**, with a long-term goal of working at the intersection of **Quantum Machine Learning** and **Drug Discovery**.

My background in **Statistics and Economics**, combined with intensive retraining in **modern AI/ML systems**, has motivated me to pursue graduate study and contribute to computational methods for biomedical research.

My journey blends a quantitative background with structured technical training, self-directed university-level coursework, and hands-on ML projects.
